This is the 3DMagic library/toolkit, 3DMagic provides services for 
three-dimensional(3D) graphics, physics, and audio. 3DMagic was made with an
intention of providing a unified toolkit to be used in development of 3D games
and simulations.

For a number of services, 3DMagic dictates a interface that can be implemented
using any number of technologies. The implementation used for each interface
is determined by the compile-time configuration that can be set through the
cmake system. The following services and implementations for each are to be
supported:
 * 3D Math      - generic, intel
 * Graphics     - null, openGL, DirectX, OGRE
 * Physics      - null, Bullet, PhysX
 * Audio        - null, openAL, DirectX, FMOD
 * GUI          - null, generic, CEGUI, GLUI

The implementations avialable are dependent on platform and applications using
3DMagic must be aware of the underlying libraries used and their licenses.

Built on top of the service interfaces, 3DMagic incldues a great ammount of
functionality built around a Object model (where each object in the virtual
environment has graphical, physical, and audio characteristics). For 
demonstrations and prototyping, 3DMagic also includes a number of default
resources including some graphical and physical models and some simple graphics
shaders. 3DMagic also includes a full resource model with built-in resource
loaders for popular model, image, and audio file formats.
